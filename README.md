# earthbound-narrative
A narrative flow chart from Earthbound(Mother 2) game (1994)

This is the product of a narrative structure study of the game. It is composed of conflict-solution-conclusion tables that are connected to each other and those follow a pretty much linear path.

Since Earthbound is partly an open world game, this chart is one of probably many possible flows that could come out from different emergent gameplay situations.

There was an effort to not include core gameplay mechanics such as specific enemy combat tactics or power up tactics. For example this chart doesn't include "Ness needs to call his mom when he feels homesick and then he is healed", since that's not part of the main story leading to the end of the game. However, you will see that Ness picks up a specific item that will be used in a specific enemy combat later in the game, since that's the only way to proceed in the main story.
